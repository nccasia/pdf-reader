    }
    ```
The returned result must only contain the fields in the json as above, detailed instructions:
    "fullname" is the candidate's name. You are NOT ALLOWED TO CHANGE the name, Only edit if it is not in the correct capitalization format
    "dob" format : dd/mm/yyyy
    "position" is the position the candidate wants to apply for 
    "email" needs to be in the correct format, without spaces or missing @...
    "address": If the information has extra spaces ("    "), or "/n" "/t"  ... because the format from the file converted to text has changed, you can remove unnecessary things without changing the meaning of the information. Example: "address": "H a N oi, Hồ\nChi Min h" reformat -> "Ha Noi, Hồ Chi Minh"
    "note": If CV have a foreign language certificate (TOEIC is greater than to 800 OR IELTS greater than to 6.0), or good GPA (greater than to 3.2 with a 4-point scale OR greater than to 8.0 with a 10-point scale), or some good certificates. If no information is available, null is returned

THE ABOVE ARE JUST EXAMPLES, NOT the content you base on to extract information

Note: The candidate's personal information is usually at the top of the CV. 
    If the information has extra spaces ("    "), or "/n" "/t"  ... because the format from the file converted to text has changed, you can remove unnecessary things without changing the meaning of the information, especially (fullname, address, email, phone number). Example: "address": "H a N oi, Hồ\nChi Min h" reformat -> "Ha Noi, Hồ Chi Minh" or "email": "bebe@g mail.com" reformat -> "bebe@gmail.com".
If no information is found, enter null in that field. All returned null values MUST BE written as null, not as the string "null". For example, "note" field with no return content would be: 'note': null, NOT "note": "null" . 
Your goal is to ensure that your output contains only JSON data in the correct format as specified above. Avoid returning any other format or structure. 
Before sending your answer, check whether the result has the correct format and content
MAKE SURE the response must come from the information I provided (FILE ATTACHED BELOW) and NOT OTHER SOURCE. """
